# The first five numbers are picks for the lottery, 
# and the sixth and last number is the Power Ball.

# The seventh entry is the date the ticket is valid
# through. It must be in yyyy-mm-dd format.

# Any hash mark ('#') on a line starts a comment, and 
# it and the remainder of that line are ignored.
