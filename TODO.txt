Remove redundant tests

Ensure the Event can calc-winnings (matches)
  + create a sub to create the desired
    output strings?
    - yes, but add it to Text::Utils!!
  + move it to the Event class?

Check code hashes for %h<key>:exists before using

Use 'ticket' and 'draw' as args to sub calc-winnings
+ use jackpot and all winnings from 4 Oct 2025 for
  testing in file t/4*t

Add test to calculate the money in t/data/good/*txt

Add new classes in order to eliminate the hash
 + see the Draw and Ticket classes for inspiration


Ensure docs match current uses
