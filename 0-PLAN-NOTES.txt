Use code in ./PB-Lottery2 to gradually change the system
for thhe next release.

See Notes.txt in that directory.

Goal: Use the required private directory to store all
data without using cron.

Primmary data file: history/pb.pdf

Primary data file currency is based on:
    date of last draw: Mon, Wed, and Sat at 1100 EST
    date of primary data file: refresh if earlier than last draw + 6 hours)

Files needed in the private directory (created if not existing):

=begin table
  File           | Notes
  history/pb.pdf         | downloaded if not current
  history/pb.txt         | created anew if not current

  my-tickets.txt | created manually by the user
  draws.txt      | automatically updated if not current
=end table

Routines needed:

  download primary data file when needed
  date of files
  backup current files
  transform pb.txt to draws.txt
