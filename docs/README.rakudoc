=head1 NAME

B<PB-Lottery> - Provides routines for handling play of US Power Ball lottery game


=head1 SYNOPSIS

=begin code :lang<raku>

use PB-Lottery;

=end code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<PB-Lottery> is intended to help the user manage his or her play in
the US Power Ball Lottery with draws every Monday, Wednesday, and
Saturday.

It uses two separate data records, in defined formats (see below), for
your tickets and the Power Ball drawings.

The drawing records must be in a file named C<drawings.txt> and your
ticket records must be in a file named C<my-tickets.txt>.

This program expects your two data files to be in a directory pointed
to by the environment variable B<PB_LOTTERY_PRIVATE_DIR>. That directory B<must>
exist in order for the program to run, and the C<draws.txt> file must exist
in order to check your results.

=head2 Ticket file format

Your lottery ticket records must be in a text file
in the following format:

=begin code
# Lottery number choices (picks)

# The first five numbers are picks for the lottery, and the sixth and
# last number is the Power Ball.

# The seventh entry is the date the ticket is valid through and must
# be in yyyy-mm-dd format.

# The remainder of the ticket line may contain one, two, or three
# optional two-character codes:

#   pp  (for the 'Power Play' add-on option)
#   dp  (for the 'Double Play' add-on option)
#   qp  (for your records if you used the 'quick pick' method)

# Any hash mark ('#') on a line starts a comment and
# it and the # remainder of that line are ignored.
# Blank lines are ignored.

# A valid example:

 02 20 32 45 47 06 2025-09-22 pp dp qp

=end code

=head2 Draw file format

Note the Power Ball lottery's B<draw> record is slightly different
from the user's ticket entry. First, it has B<two> lines per draw date. The
B<first> line is the actual 'Power Ball' draw. The B<second> line is the
'Double Play' draw.  The two lines for each draw data B<must> be in a
text file in the following format (note two draw dates are shown):

=begin code
# Powerball lottery draws

# draw on 2025-09-01
08 23 25 40 53 05 2025-09-01 pb # <= the Power Ball draw
10 15 26 48 67 19 2025-09-01 dp # <= the Double Play draw

# next draw
# draw on 2025-09-03
03 16 29 61 69 22 2025-09-03 pb # <= the Power Ball draw
07 32 39 50 61 04 2025-09-03 dp # <= the Double Play draw

=end code

=head2 Finding results

In the author's state of Florida, Power Ball lottery results can be
found at L<https://floridalottery.com>.  Other states will have their
own lottery sites, but the results for any Power Ball lottery should be
the same on each states' lottery site for the same date.
